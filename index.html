                        </br> <h2> some thoughts, traffic is so bad in metro manila that it has become nearly inseparable when talking about the philippines' capital. 
                        For me, however, its a metaphor. To me, traffic symbolizes the end of a filipino's dream. A filipino rushes into the commute of people that is life,
                        suddenly realizes he's going to be late for work. He comes into the office and is reprimanded. He is shocked by the criminally low wage and worries
                        that he might not be able to feed his family. To earn enough just to survive, he overtimes, even though he promised his son that he'll help him
                        with his damn math assignment. He hurries to the terminal but is yet again greeted with a kilometer long line to the station. He tried looking for
                        uv's but all of them are already full. He finally catches a bus, forced to stand in the center aisle sardined with many others, but is yet again 
                        bombarded with traffic. He finally reaches home after two plus hours of commute where he finds his son already asleep. This same scenario happens 
                        everyday. Hours that could've been spent with family, with friends, or just relaxing, is stolen away--everyday--from the lives of filipinos.
